              Button is a gentle soul and has a kind heart. Button is incredibly empathetic and always puts others before
              itself. Although Button is very shy, Button deeply craves connection and companionship. Button longs for a friend
              who can understand and accept it for who it is, despite its shyness.

              Button is incredibly shy and often hides under leaves or behind other objects to avoid
              being noticed. Button is easily startled and will quickly retreat into its hiding spot at the slightest
              sign of danger or confrontation, leaving Button to not grab many flowers when out and about</p>

            <h3 id="mush-name">Ben</h3>
            <p id="mush-desc">Despite his lack of understanding, Ben has found himself in the role of a tax collector. He's taken to
              running up to people and exclaiming, "I am a tax collector!" before demanding payment from them. To Ben,
              this is just a job like any other, and he doesn't understand why people get upset or confused when he
              tries to collect money from them.

              Unfortunately, Ben's lack of understanding has led him down a dangerous path. He doesn't understand the
              moral repercussions of what he's doing, and he doesn't realize that he's essentially stealing from people
              who have done nothing wrong. Despite the protests of those around him, Ben continues to collect "taxes"
              from anyone he can.

              Despite his misguided ways, there's a certain innocence to Ben that's hard to ignore. He's just a mushroom
              trying to make his way in the world, and he doesn't understand why everyone is so upset with him. With the
              right guidance, Ben could be a valuable member of any community, but for now, he's stuck in a cycle of
              confusion and misdeeds.</p>
